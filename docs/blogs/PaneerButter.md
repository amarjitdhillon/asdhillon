Please give it a try and let me know how it worked out for you 😀. Special thanks to [Rahul Dahra](https://www.facebook.com/rahul.dahra.5) for asking for the recipe which gave me an idea to share it with you guys. Here are the steps.

* Put 2 tablespoons of desi ghee into a pan .
* Add a teaspoon of cumin seeds, some khada masalas such as red chilis 🌶🌶 (as per your taste ) and a handful of cashews (optional).
* Sauté them for 1-2 minutes on medium flame.
* Add 3 finely chopped onions, add sliced ginger root, fresh garlic 🧄, salt, turmeric and chili powder (as per taste) to the pan.
* Sauté then until onions are golden brown.
* Then add 2-3 finely chopped tomato 🍅 and sauté for few minutes until tomatoes are nice and mushy. 
* Turn off the stove and cool the mixture.
* The next step is to make a gravy for which you will need a hand blender/ a mixer jar. Grind to make a fine paste and keep it in a separate container.

!!! warn ""
    Please be careful as the masala mixture you made is hot. You can add some water before blending it. I used a hand blender for this purpose.

* Now add some more ghee to the fresh pan. You can use the same pan after cleaning it.
* Cut 2 onions, each onion into 4 big pieces. 
* Add roughly onions 🧅, chopped capsicum, and condiments as per taste.
* Sauté them for 1-2 minutes.
* Add paneer pieces to the pan. I haven't dipped panner in corn starch paste, but you can. 
* Sauté them until the paneer is golden brown.
* Now add the gravy you made earlier to this pan. Close the lid and cook for ~ 10 minutes on low flame.
* Add milk/cream as per your taste. You can add water to make gravy less thick to achieve the right consistency.
* Garnish with Kasuri methi and freshly chopped coriander leaves.
* Serve with Nan or roti.
