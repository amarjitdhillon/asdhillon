Check out the below quick tips and share them with your loved ones:

1. Vitamin C and D: Having a deficiency in vitamin C weakens your metabolism. Also, you will need to consume vitamin D to make sure vitamin C is processed properly. As you might be self-isolating, so it's a good idea to take a multivitamin along with your meal to make sure you are not missing out essential vitamins. Please check the daily value (DV) for that multi-vitamin. If some vitamin is below than 100% DV, then you should consume the rest from your food.

1. Drink a plenty of hot water 💧. If possible keep a hot water kettle in your room .

1. Have electrolytes. Being on Keto for a which I've had some electrolyte solutions with me already. Please check your local drug store.

1. Drink green tea 🍵, ginger-lemon, ginger-turmeric tea. If you don't have those then, heat some water and add freshly cut ginger, some garlic, honey to it and drink several times a day.

1. Hame some hot soups 🍜

1. Gargle with hot salt water 2-3 times a day and especially before you go to bed. Your water kettle will come in handy for this.
