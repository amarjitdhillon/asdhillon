Check out the below quick tips and share them with your loved ones:

1. Vitamin C and D: Having a deficiency in vitamin C weakens your metabolism. Also, you will need to consume vitamin D to make sure vitamin C is processed properly. As you might be self-isolating, so it's a good idea to take a multivitamin along with your meal to make sure you are not missing out essential vitamins. Please check the daily value (DV) for that multi-vitamin. If some vitamin is below than 100% DV, then you should consume the rest from your food.

1. Drink a plenty of hot water 💧. If possible keep a hot water kettle in your room .

1. Have electrolytes. Being on Keto for a which I've had some electrolyte solutions with me already. Please check your local drug store.

1. Drink green tea 🍵, ginger-lemon, ginger-turmeric tea. If you don't have those then, heat some water and add freshly cut ginger, some garlic, honey to it and drink several times a day.

1. Have some hot soups 🍜

1. Gargle with hot salt water 2-3 times a day and especially before you go to bed. Your water kettle will come in handy for this.

1. Use humidifier if you have it  

1. Make sure to eat some fresh fruits such as oranges 🍊, Pineapple, Kiwi 🥝, Papaya, Berries. You can bring some juices from Costco in bulk which can last for 2 weeks and keep it in your room.

1. Having some raw veggies such as carrots 🥕, cabbage 🥬, cauliflower, bell peepers is a great way to increase the metabolism. You can fetch some frozen melange of the veggies which are easy to saute/ microwave.
